# 🚀 CoreTaskManager

A modern, header-only C++/Qt library for **safe and efficient task execution in separate threads**, with built-in support for grouping, cooperative stopping, and type-safe registration.

 💡 Think of it as a lightweight, flexible alternative to `QThreadPool` + `QFuture`, but with more control and cleaner C++20-style API.

## ✨ Why CoreTaskManager?

- ✅ **Zero overhead**: Header-only, no extra dependencies.
- ✅ **Type-safe**: Compile-time checks for function signatures (thanks to `std::function`, `if constexpr`, `std::any`).
- ✅ **Grouping**: Run only one task per group (e.g., "network", "file I/O").
- ✅ **Cooperative cancellation**: Tasks can check `stopTaskFlag()` and exit gracefully.
- ✅ **Modern C++**: Uses `std::atomic`, `std::bind`, `enum class`, `QMetaType`, `QSharedPointer`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```cpp
// 1. Init task manager
auto m_pCore = new Core();

// 2. Register a task
m_pCore->registerTask(TASK_CALCULATE, [](int a, int b) -> int {
    QThread::msleep(100); // Simulate work
    return a + b;
});

// 3. Add it to the queue
m_pCore->addTask(TASK_CALCULATE, 10, 20);

// 4. Handle result
connect(m_pCore, &Core::finishedTask, this, [](TaskId id, TaskType type, const QVariant& result) {
    qDebug() << "Result:" << result.toInt();
});
```

## 📦 Installation

Just copy core.h into your project. It's header-only!

## 🧪 Example

See **example/** directory for a full Qt Widgets app demonstrating all features.

*For Qt6, it is preferable to use **CMakeLists.txt** when opening a project, and if Qt5 then **example_app.pro**.*

## Features

- Executes registered functions/lambdas/functors in dedicated threads.
- Supports task grouping (only one task per group runs at a time).
- Provides mechanisms for stopping and terminating tasks.
- Allows querying task status (registered, idle, added by type/group).

## Architecture and Usage Rules

**IMPORTANT:** The `Core` class is **not thread-safe** for its public interface methods. To ensure stability:

- **All calls to public methods** (e.g., `registerTask`, `addTask`, `stopTaskById`, `terminateTaskById`, `isTask...`, etc.) **must originate from the same thread** where the `Core` object lives. Typically, this is the **main GUI thread**.
- Functions registered via `registerTask` are executed in their own dedicated threads managed by the library.
- Code running inside a registered task function **should avoid calling public `Core` methods directly**, as this can lead to race conditions and undefined behavior. If a task needs to interact with the `Core`, it should use `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` to send a message to the main thread, which then performs the action safely.

## Public API

- `registerTask`: Registers a function/lambda/functor for later execution by type.
- `addTask`: Adds a registered task to the execution queue.
- `unregisterTask`: Removes a task type from registration.
- `stopTaskById`, `stopTaskByType`, `stopTaskByGroup`, `stopTasks`: Request graceful stop of tasks.
- `terminateTaskById`: Forcefully terminates a task by ID.
- `isTaskRegistered`, `isIdle`, `isTaskAddedByType`, `isTaskAddedByGroup`: Query task status.
- `groupByTask`: Get the group associated with a task type.
- `stopTaskFlag`: Get a flag for the current thread to allow cooperative stopping within a task function.

## Threading Model

1. Main Thread: Hosts the `Core` object. All public API calls should come from here.
2. Task Threads: Created internally by the library for each task execution. Registered functions run here.
3. Communication: Interaction between Task Threads and Main Thread happens via Qt's signal/slot mechanism (e.g., `TaskHelper::finished`) or `QTimer` events scheduled on the main thread (e.g., in `stopTask`).

## Safety Considerations

- Adhering to the single-threaded access rule for the public API is crucial.
- Be cautious with `QTimer::singleShot` and `connect` callbacks if they access shared data outside of `Core`'s internal structures, especially if those accesses are not synchronized or atomic.
- The `Core` class uses Qt types (`QList`, `QHash`, `QSharedPointer`) which manage their own lifetimes. However, the concurrent access to these types from different threads is avoided by the usage rules.

## How It Works

1. An instance of the `Core` class is created.
2. Callables are registered with `Core::registerTask(...)`, assigning them a unique `taskType` integer and optional group and timeout settings.
3. Tasks are queued for execution using `Core::addTask(taskType, ...args)`.
4. The `Core` manages a queue and ensures only one task per group runs at a time.
5. When a slot opens up (either due to a previous task finishing or because the task belongs to a different group), the `Core` starts the next eligible task in its own thread using `CreateThread` (Windows) or `pthread_create` (Unix-like systems).
6. The task's associated function executes within the new thread.
7. While executing, a task can check a shared stop flag retrieved via `Core::stopTaskFlag()` to perform graceful shutdowns.
8. Upon completion (normal, stopped, or terminated), the task emits a signal (`finishedTask`, `terminatedTask`) back to the main thread where the `Core` lives.
9. The `Core` updates its internal lists of active and queued tasks and proceeds to start the next queued task if applicable.

## Important Notes

- **Platform Specifics:** The library uses `CreateThread`/`TerminateThread` on Windows and `pthread_create`/`pthread_cancel` on Unix-like systems for low-level thread management.
- **Thread Safety:** The `Core` object itself is designed to be used from the main thread (or a single managing thread). Its methods for adding/stopping tasks are called from the main thread, and its signals are emitted from the main thread context. Access to the internal stop flag (`Core::stopTaskFlag()`) is intended for use *within* the executing task's thread.
- **Header-Only:** The library is implemented entirely within `core.h` as an inline/header-only library.
- **Requirements:** Requires Qt 6.x (specifically tested against 6.10.2) and C++17 support.

## Prerequisites

- Qt6.x (tested with 6.10.2, but theoretically it can also work on Qt5)
- C++17 compatible compiler

## Basic Example

```cpp
#include "core.h"
#include <QApplication>
#include <QDebug>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    Core core;

    // Define a simple task
    auto simpleTask = [](int x) -> int {
        qDebug() << "Running simple task with arg:" << x;
        return x * 2;
    };

    // Register the task with type ID 1
    core.registerTask(1, simpleTask);

    // Connect to the finished signal to handle results
    QObject::connect(&core, &Core::finishedTask, [](long id, int type, const QVariantList &args, const QVariant &result) {
        qDebug() << "Task finished:" << id << "Type:" << type << "Args:" << args << "Result:" << result;
    });

    // Add the task for execution with argument 21
    core.addTask(1, 21);

    // Your application event loop would normally run here.
    // For this example, we'll just wait a bit to see the task complete.
    QTimer timer;
    timer.setSingleShot(true);
    timer.start(2000); // Wait 2 seconds
    QObject::connect(&timer, &QTimer::timeout, &app, &QApplication::quit);

    return app.exec();
}
```

## Grouping Example

```cpp
#include "core.h"
#include <QApplication>
#include <QDebug>
#include <QThread>
#include <QTimer>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    Core core;

    // Define tasks for Group 1 (Resource A)
    auto taskForResourceA1 = [](int id) -> int {
        qDebug() << "Group 1 Task" << id << "- Starting on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();
        QThread::msleep(2000); // Simulate work taking 2 seconds
        qDebug() << "Group 1 Task" << id << "- Finished";
        return id * 10;
    };

    auto taskForResourceA2 = [](int id) -> int {
        qDebug() << "Group 1 Task" << id << "- Starting on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();
        QThread::msleep(1000); // Simulate work taking 1 second
        qDebug() << "Group 1 Task" << id << "- Finished";
        return id * 20;
    };

    // Define a task for Group 2 (Resource B) - Can run concurrently with Group 1
    auto taskForResourceB = [](int id) -> int {
        qDebug() << "Group 2 Task" << id << "- Starting on thread:" << QThread::currentThread();
        QThread::msleep(1500); // Simulate work taking 1.5 seconds
        qDebug() << "Group 2 Task" << id << "- Finished";
        return id * 30;
    };

    // Register tasks. Group 1 tasks will be serialized.
    core.registerTask(1, taskForResourceA1, 1); // Task type 1, Group 1
    core.registerTask(2, taskForResourceA2, 1); // Task type 2, Group 1
    core.registerTask(3, taskForResourceB, 2);  // Task type 3, Group 2

    QObject::connect(&core, &Core::finishedTask, [](long id, int type, const QVariantList &args, const QVariant &result) {
        qDebug() << "Task completed - ID:" << id << "Type:" << type << "Group:" << args.first().toInt() << "Result:" << result;
    });

    // Add tasks
    qDebug() << "Adding Group 1 Task 1 (ID: 10)";
    core.addTask(1, 10); // Will start immediately

    qDebug() << "Adding Group 1 Task 2 (ID: 20) - Should wait for Task 1";
    core.addTask(2, 20); // Will wait in queue behind Task 1

    qDebug() << "Adding Group 2 Task 1 (ID: 30) - Should start immediately, parallel to Group 1 Task 1";
    core.addTask(3, 30); // Will start immediately as it's in Group 2

    // Wait longer to ensure all tasks complete
    QTimer timer;
    timer.setSingleShot(true);
    timer.start(6000); // Wait 6 seconds
    QObject::connect(&timer, &QTimer::timeout, &app, &QApplication::quit);

    return app.exec();
}
/* Expected Output (order might vary slightly due to timing):
